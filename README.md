Visual Recognition of Cued Speech

These are the Jupyter notebooks used in my final project for my masters.
The main notebooks are the CSRecognitionFinalConsonant and CSRecognitionFinalVowel.
These are the ones which contain the final network models used to recognise consonant and vowel phonemes respectively in cued speech.
The RescaleImages notebook was used to create new datasets of the images by scaling them down to be easier to process.
The label_maker.py was a simple script used to extract the names of the images in the dataset and print them all to a single .txt file.
